## Introduction

This is a search app which uses fuzzy search to search jobs from MongoDB database.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js (version 12.0.0 or later)
- npm (version 6.0.0 or later) or Yarn (version 1.22.0 or later)

## Installation

To install the necessary packages, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Using npm:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

   Or using Yarn:

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

## Running the Development Server

To run the development server, use the following command:

Using npm:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Or using Yarn:

```sh
yarn dev
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`. Open your browser and navigate to this URL to see the application in development mode.

## Building for Production

To build the project for production, run:

Using npm:

```sh
npm run build
```

Or using Yarn:

```sh
yarn build
```

This will create an optimized build of your application in the `.next` directory.
